# stats220

This is my repo for STATS 220. 

A little about me:

- I am undertaking a degree in Bachelor of Science majoring in Data Science
- I am taking STATS 220 because it will give me a more comprehensive understanding and proficiency in tools like R, HTML, Markdown, CSS, etc. I am of course also taking it because this course is required for Data Science.
- I am interested in learning about all the different applications and uses of data technology, learning how to store, process, and manipulate data in a way that gives us a better understanding of the world around us.
