## This is my repo for STATS 220. 

### 1. A little about me:

- I am undertaking a degree in Bachelor of Science majoring in _**Data Science**_
- I am taking _**STATS 220**_ because it will give me a more comprehensive understanding and proficiency in tools like R, HTML, Markdown, CSS, etc. I am also taking it because this course is required for Data Science.
- I am interested in learning about all the different applications and uses of data technology, including how to store, process, and manipulate data to better understand the world around us.
